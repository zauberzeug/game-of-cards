title: pattern-generalization-stop-hook-reminder-never-reaches-the-agent
summary: "The pattern-generalization Stop hook prints its reminder to stdout and returns 0. For a Claude Code Stop hook, exit-0 stdout is shown only to the user in transcript mode — it is NOT injected into the model's context. So the agent never sees the self-assessment prompt and the hook has been inert (for its stated purpose) since it shipped. The sibling SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit hooks use the same print()+return-0 idiom correctly, because those hook types DO inject stdout into context — the Stop hook copied an idiom that does not transfer."

# Pattern-generalization Stop hook reminder never reaches the agent

## Location

`goc/templates/hooks/pattern_generalization_check.py:134-137`

```python
    if _had_code_mutation(transcript_path):
        print(REMINDER)

    return 0
```

(The consumer mirror `.claude/hooks/pattern_generalization_check.py`,
`claude-plugin/hooks/...`, and `codex-plugin/hooks/...` carry the same
code; the OpenClaw TS port at `openclaw-plugin/index.ts` does NOT — see
below.)

## What's broken

This is a **Stop** hook (its docstring, line 1: *"Stop hook — prompt
agent to file generalization cards…"*; registered on the `Stop` event).
It emits its reminder with `print(REMINDER)` and then `return 0`.

In Claude Code's hook contract, a hook's behavior on **exit code 0**
differs by event type:

- For **`UserPromptSubmit`** and **`SessionStart`**, stdout *is* added
  to the model's context.
- For **every other event, including `Stop`**, exit-0 stdout is shown
  only to the *user* in transcript mode (Ctrl-R). It is **not** injected
  into the model's context.

To get text in front of the agent from a Stop hook you must either exit
code `2` with the message on **stderr** (which blocks the stop and feeds
stderr back to the model), or emit JSON `{"decision": "block", "reason":
"…"}` (also blocks the stop, `reason` shown to the model). There is no
non-blocking channel from a Stop hook to the model — once the agent has
stopped, there is nothing left to inject into.

So the `REMINDER` string is silently dropped: `_had_code_mutation`
correctly fires on code-mutating turns, but the prompt the agent is
supposed to self-assess against never arrives. The hook has been a
no-op for its stated purpose since it shipped (the feature card
[agent-flags-unfiled-pattern-generalization-cards-before-stop](../agent-flags-unfiled-pattern-generalization-cards-before-stop/),
closed 2026-05-06).

### The idiom was copied from hooks where it works

The two sibling hooks emit the identical way and are **correct**,
because their event types inject stdout into context:

- `goc/templates/hooks/deck_session_start.py` (SessionStart) —
  `print(f"[GoC] Active card(s): …")`. We can see this one working: the
  SessionStart reminder appears injected at the top of every session.
- `goc/templates/hooks/deck_prompt_router.py` (UserPromptSubmit) —
  `print(REMINDER)`.

The Stop hook reused `print()+return 0` from these without accounting
for the event-type difference in the exit-0 stdout contract. The
OpenClaw TS port of the same logic (`openclaw-plugin/index.ts`) instead
calls the host's explicit notify/append-context API, which is why it
does not exhibit the bug — further evidence the Python sibling is the
outlier.

## Empirical evidence

The defect is in the host runtime's routing of exit-0 stdout for Stop
events, which `reproduce.py` cannot exercise without the Claude Code
runtime. Instead the reproducer asserts the *observable code property*
that proves the bug: the hook writes the reminder to **stdout** and
exits **0** — neither the exit-2/stderr nor the JSON-block channel that
a Stop hook needs to reach the model. See `reproduce.py` output pasted
in `log.md` at implementation time.

## Why it matters

The whole point of this hook is to nudge the agent — on code-mutating
turns — to file generalization cards it would otherwise forget (the
failure mode the originating card documents: narrow work ships, the
broader pattern evaporates with the conversation). Because the nudge
never reaches the agent, that failure mode is entirely un-mitigated
while the deck's documentation (and the originating card's DoD item:
*"the agent is expected to file via Skill(create-card) before yielding;
the hook's prompt explicitly says so"*) claims it is handled. Silent
doc/behavior drift on a methodology mechanism.

## Decision

*Resolved 2026-05-30T13:36:33Z:* Block-the-stop: make the hook functional by switching to exit code 2 with REMINDER on stderr (or JSON {decision:block,reason:REMINDER})

*Reasoning:* the existing stop_hook_active guard makes the re-block loop safe and the false-positive cost is just one continuation turn per code-mutating stop, so the hook finally delivers the agent-facing nudge its card promises instead of being silently inert
